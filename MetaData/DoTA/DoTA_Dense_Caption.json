A pedestrian walking a bicycle along the right side of the road suddenly crosses the road without noticing an approaching vehicle. As the vehicle approaches at high speed, the pedestrian does not alter posture or speed, nor shows signs of hesitation, resulting in a collision that causes the bicycle and pedestrian to be propelled forward and off the road surface.

The first woman, wearing a red coat and dark pants, walks slowly across the crosswalk. The second woman, dressed in a black padded jacket, holds the child's hand as they cross together. At this moment, a black sedan traveling at approximately 60 km/h approaches the crosswalk at high speed, appearing to lose control. Based on the vehicle's motion, it seems the driver noticed the pedestrians late and attempted to swerve left in an evasive maneuver. The pedestrians, upon seeing the rapidly approaching vehicle, react quickly to avoid it, narrowly escaping a serious collision. The incident concludes as the vehicle comes to a stop. This near-miss vividly illustrates how speeding vehicles at crosswalks can lead to highly dangerous situations, highlighting the severe risks posed by failing to reduce speed in pedestrian-priority zones."

The SUV driver appears unaware of the pedestrian's movement and continues driving without reducing speed, leading the vehicle directly into the pedestrian's path. As the pedestrian crosses the road, the vehicle reaches the point of intersection, resulting in an immediate collision. The crash is attributed to the pedestrian crossing the road without obeying the traffic signal, and the incident concludes with the pedestrian and vehicle colliding near the center of the roadway."

The scene takes place on a dry, two-lane asphalt road with a dashed white center line and guardrails on both sides. An adult pedestrian, dressed in dark clothing and standing upright, is positioned directly in the path of the dashcam vehicle, on the roadway itself. At the time, the dashcam vehicle is traveling straight at approximately 70 km/h, and the pedestrian is obscured due to the low visibility conditions. As the vehicle approaches and comes within close range, the driver suddenly spots the pedestrian and immediately steers left in an attempt to avoid a collision. As a result, a major crash is averted, and a near-miss or possibly a minor impact occurs along the right side of the vehicle. This incident illustrates how low nighttime visibility and the pedestrian's violation of traffic rules contributed to the event.

Suddenly, the leading vehicle brakes abruptly, prompting the dashcam vehicle to steer right in an evasive maneuver to avoid a rear-end collision. At that moment, a male pedestrian—wearing a dark top and jeans—is standing on the right shoulder of the road. As a result, while the dashcam vehicle successfully avoids colliding with the car ahead, the evasive action leads to a collision with the pedestrian. The impact pushes the pedestrian slightly forward, and the dashcam vehicle decelerates immediately after the crash. This incident clearly illustrates how a sudden stop by a vehicle on the roadway, combined with a pedestrian positioned on the shoulder, can lead to an unexpected accident through a chain of spatial and temporal interactions."

A male pedestrian, dressed in a white top and jeans, is seen standing on the roadway. Despite the presence of oncoming vehicles, the pedestrian remains in place, showing no intent to move. At the same time, three vehicles are approaching: the dashcam vehicle, a black sedan positioned ahead and to the left of the dashcam car, and a large truck traveling to the left of the dashcam vehicle—all moving at an estimated speed of 60-70 km/h. The black sedan, being the foremost vehicle, notices the pedestrian and quickly swerves left, narrowly avoiding a collision. Simultaneously, the large truck also detects the pedestrian and attempts to evade by steering right, which results in a collision with the dashcam vehicle. Due to the obstructed view from the dashcam perspective, it is unclear whether the truck collided directly with the pedestrian. However, it is evident that at least a near-miss occurred. This incident serves as a spatial-temporal example of how a pedestrian's violation of traffic regulations can trigger a chain of dangerous interactions and multiple near-collisions or crashes among surrounding vehicles."

The involved vehicle is a dark-colored Volkswagen sedan, which approaches the crosswalk from the pedestrian's right side at an estimated speed of 50 km/h. As the pedestrian comes into close proximity, the driver begins to decelerate. However, due to the slippery road surface, the driver judges that a full stop may not be possible and attempts to steer left to avoid the collision. Despite this evasive maneuver, the vehicle's right side collides with the pedestrian. The vehicle eventually comes to a stop near the roadside, marking the end of the incident. This accident exemplifies how a sudden pedestrian entry combined with poor traction on snow-covered roads can result in a rapid and unavoidable collision.

As the pedestrian steps directly into the vehicle's path, the driver attempts to decelerate and steer right to avoid a collision. However, the vehicle strikes the pedestrian, causing her to be thrown into a snowbank near the bus stop due to the force of the impact. The vehicle continues veering right and crashes into a utility pole, resulting in significant damage to the front-right bumper. Prior to the collision, the pedestrian shows no hesitation or signs of checking for oncoming traffic before entering the roadway.

At the same time, a dashcam-equipped vehicle is approaching the crosswalk in a straight line from a distance at approximately 60 km/h. Despite the pedestrian on the crosswalk being obscured by the bus, the vehicle fails to noticeably reduce speed as it nears the crossing. As the pedestrian enters the vehicle's path, the driver attempts to brake, but the high speed prevents a full stop in time, resulting in a direct collision with the pedestrian. The impact causes the pedestrian to fall onto the roadway, and the vehicle ultimately comes to a stop on the right-hand sidewalk.

At that moment, a white sedan is traveling straight at approximately 40 km/h relative to the dashcam vehicle. The sedan's driver has an obstructed view of the pedestrian due to the presence of the dashcam vehicle, which blocks the line of sight. As the pedestrian steps into the sedan's path, the driver attempts an emergency brake maneuver. However, due to the icy surface and limited braking distance, the vehicle fails to decelerate in time and collides forcefully with the pedestrian. The impact causes the pedestrian to fall onto the roadway. This scene illustrates a collision between a pedestrian and a vehicle under slippery winter conditions, highlighting how jaywalking without awareness of oncoming traffic can directly lead to a serious accident."

The vehicle is traveling at a relatively low speed of approximately 30 km/h. As the vehicle attempts to pass the bus, the pedestrian abruptly steps into its path. Due to the short braking distance, a collision occurs between the vehicle and the pedestrian. After the impact, the vehicle comes to a stop. The pedestrian is slightly pushed by the impact but does not fall, suggesting that the collision was of low severity.

The white van decelerates and comes to a stop. The pedestrians begin to cross in front of the white van, but a black sedan is simultaneously approaching from behind the van's right rear side. Due to the van blocking its line of sight, the black sedan is unable to see the pedestrians crossing. As a result, the front of the black sedan collides with both pedestrians. The impact causes the pedestrians to be thrown onto the hood of the black vehicle before falling to the road surface. The black sedan comes to an immediate stop upon impact. The small truck in front of the dashcam vehicle remains stationary throughout the incident. The ambient lighting conditions suggest that the event takes place in the late afternoon or early evening."
