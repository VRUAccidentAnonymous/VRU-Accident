    "gt": "This incident takes place on a dry urban road during the daytime under clear weather conditions, with moderate traffic. The surrounding area features high-rise residential buildings. The pedestrian?a man in his 30s wearing a blue plaid short-sleeved shirt, dark jeans, and black shoes?is seen standing on a paved planter area at the edge of the road, talking on his phone. At that moment, a light-colored sedan is traveling straight in the right lane at approximately 30 km/h, while other vehicles are moving steadily in the left lane. Due to uneven terrain near the edge of the road, the pedestrian missteps, loses his balance, and falls onto the roadway. As he falls, he lightly bumps into the side of a nearby gray vehicle, but the impact is minimal and does not significantly contribute to the incident. In summary, the fall was primarily caused by the uneven roadside surface rather than any direct action by the vehicles, and the gray car had no substantial role in the outcome of the incident."

    "gt": "This incident occurs at a multi-lane urban intersection paved with dry, flat asphalt under clear daytime weather conditions. The intersection accommodates two-way traffic and is equipped with traffic signals. A female pedestrian, wearing a red shirt and dark pants, runs quickly from the right sidewalk toward the left, attempting to cross the road. As she runs, the pedestrian signal changes from red to green for vehicles, prompting her to realize she cannot make it across in time. She then decides to abort the crossing and abruptly changes direction. However, while making the sudden turn at speed, she loses balance due to momentum and falls onto the roadway. Importantly, the nearby vehicles, which were previously stopped at the light, do not directly influence the incident. The accident results from the pedestrian's own violation of traffic rules and misjudgment during the attempted crossing."

    "gt": "A male cyclist wearing a white shirt and gray pants approaches a flat, multi-lane asphalt road under clear and dry weather conditions. The road is wide and features a clearly marked pedestrian zebra crossing. The cyclist is riding upright at a moderate speed, traveling from left to right. As the cyclist crosses the road using the marked crosswalk and nears the right-side sidewalk, he fails to notice the curb separating the road from the sidewalk. While continuing to ride, his front wheel strikes the curb, causing him to lose balance and fall onto the sidewalk. This incident results from the cyclist's inattention and failure to recognize the change in road level, making it a self-caused accident due to rider negligence."

    "gt": "This scene depicts an accident that occurs on a city arterial road under overcast weather conditions. The road is a two-lane asphalt surface with moderate traffic flow. The cyclist, dressed in light-colored clothing, emerges at very high speed from a narrow alleyway between buildings on the right side and enters the road. As the cyclist enters the roadway, he spots oncoming vehicles and attempts to brake suddenly. However, due to the wet surface caused by rain, the braking is ineffective, leading him to lose balance and fall. He then slides along with the bicycle toward the road, eventually being pushed into the path of an approaching red bus. Fortunately, the red bus driver recognizes the situation in time and swerves to the right, successfully avoiding a direct collision with the cyclist. This incident clearly illustrates the dangers posed by sudden entry and abrupt braking on a slippery surface. It emphasizes how an unexpected change of direction, combined with wet asphalt conditions, can quickly escalate into a potential accident."

    "gt": "A pedestrian, appearing to be in his 30s and wearing a yellow T-shirt and black shorts, crosses a dry, multi-lane urban asphalt road via a marked crosswalk from right to left under clear skies and sunny weather. At the same time, from the pedestrian's right side, an adult male cyclist dressed in white approaches along the road, failing to notice the pedestrian ahead. As a result, the cyclist collides with the pedestrian, and the cyclist falls onto the crosswalk. Simultaneously, a white van is approaching the crosswalk at approximately 30 km/h. At the moment the cyclist falls, the van enters the crosswalk and strikes the cyclist with its front-right section. The van comes to a stop on the crosswalk immediately after the collision. This incident vividly illustrates how a cyclist's inattention can lead to a primary collision with a pedestrian, and how that initial impact can cascade into a secondary collision involving a motor vehicle?demonstrating the spatial and temporal dynamics of multi-party accidents in urban traffic environments."

    "gt": "On a clear day, a male cyclist wearing a dark jacket and jeans is riding a bicycle along a lightly trafficked, paved two-lane road in a commercial area. The cyclist, traveling from the right side of the road, begins to turn left into an alleyway toward the direction of a vehicle equipped with a dashcam. Upon noticing the dashcam vehicle, the cyclist suddenly brakes hard, causing his body to lurch forward due to momentum and resulting in a fall onto the road surface. The dashcam vehicle was moving slowly at approximately 10 km/h and was able to avoid a direct collision thanks to its low speed. This incident highlights the importance of cautious riding by cyclists, especially when navigating blind corners or turns where visibility is limited."

    "gt": "A male cyclist wearing a blue jacket and black pants is riding on a narrow, dry asphalt road within a residential area flanked by multi-story houses and well-maintained greenery. The weather is clear with bright daylight, but the cyclist's visibility is limited due to the curved road, roadside trees, and nearby buildings. At this time, the dashcam-equipped vehicle is traveling at a slow speed of approximately 20 km/h. Upon spotting the vehicle, the cyclist abruptly applies the brakes, but due to momentum, he loses balance and falls onto the road in front of the vehicle. Thanks to the vehicle's low speed and the driver's prompt braking, a direct collision is narrowly avoided. This incident highlights how limited visibility in residential areas, coupled with cyclist inattention and wrong-way riding, can pose significant safety risks and potentially lead to accidents."

    "gt": "The cyclist, a male wearing a white and blue cycling outfit with the number 31 on his back and a white helmet, is riding along the right shoulder of a dry, two-lane asphalt road lined with trees on both sides under clear and sunny weather conditions. The area has light traffic, and the cyclist maintains a steady pace. Ahead of him, a red Toyota vehicle is traveling in the right lane at approximately 40 km/h. As the vehicle approaches a roadside driveway, the driver suddenly makes an un signaled right turn, cutting into the cyclist's intended path. In response, the cyclist immediately brakes hard to avoid the vehicle and, due to inertia, is thrown forward and falls onto the road. Thanks to the cyclist's quick reaction, direct contact with the vehicle is avoided. This incident vividly illustrates how an unexpected right turn by a vehicle without warning can create a sudden and dangerous situation, highlighting the potential for serious accidents even without direct impact."

The recording vehicle is stationary, and a white sedan is also stopped near the curb ahead. At this moment, a female cyclist wearing a light gray coat and a pink apron rides an electric bicycle with a front basket, approaching from the right sidewalk and attempting to cross the road in front of the recording vehicle. Simultaneously, a male cyclist?dressed in black clothing and riding a gray bicycle?travels straight along the road from the rear left side of the recording vehicle. His view of the female cyclist is obstructed by the recording vehicle. As the female cyclist emerges from in front of the stationary vehicle, the two cyclists collide, causing the male cyclist to fall onto the roadway from the impact. This incident vividly illustrates how the female cyclist's sudden road entry and the male cyclist's ongoing travel can result in a collision, particularly when visibility is limited by other vehicles."

The first cyclist, dressed in white clothing and carrying a black backpack, leads slightly ahead, while the second cyclist, dressed in black, closely follows beside him. Without paying adequate attention, the second cyclist veers from right to left toward the direction of the first cyclist and ultimately collides with him. The impact causes both cyclists to fall onto the roadway. At that moment, a vehicle equipped with a dashcam is following the two cyclists at a slow speed while maintaining a safe distance from behind. As soon as the cyclists collide, the vehicle brakes immediately, successfully avoiding any further collision."
