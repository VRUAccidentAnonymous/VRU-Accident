A dashcam vehicle is traveling in the center lane, and ahead of it, a male cyclist wearing a yellow shirt and black pants is riding. The cyclist soon begins to change lanes to the left, appearing to attempt a full crossing toward the opposite side of the road. The roadway is separated from oncoming traffic by yellow guide posts and double solid yellow lines. As the cyclist moves left, a black motorcycle—ridden by an individual wearing a red outfit and white helmet—approaches from behind in the left lane. The cyclist seems unaware of the approaching motorcycle. Moments later, the bicycle and motorcycle collide. The cyclist falls to the ground, and the motorcyclist also crashes after hitting one of the yellow guide posts. This incident appears to have been caused by the cyclist’s improper lane-crossing maneuver without adequately checking for vehicles approaching from behind."

The pedestrian abruptly moves onto the roadway, crouching and leaning forward as he steps directly into the right lane in front of a slow-moving blue dump truck traveling straight at an estimated speed of 20 km/h. A white passenger car, approaching from the opposite lane at a higher speed, suddenly swerves left into the same right lane, colliding forcefully with the pedestrian. The impact causes the pedestrian to be launched onto the road beside the dump truck's right rear wheel before coming to rest near the curbside. Throughout the sequence, the pedestrian shows no clear attempt to avoid the truck but appears to react to the approaching white car. The vehicles and pedestrian are clearly visible against the urban backdrop of leafless trees and buildings. The collision highlights the abrupt pedestrian entry, the evasive maneuver by the passing car, and the consequent multi-point impact dynamics."

However, due to a misjudgment in distance, the front passenger-side area of the moving vehicle collides with the pedestrian. The vehicle comes to a stop immediately after the collision. This sequence illustrates how a sudden entry into the roadway from between parked vehicles, combined with the dashcam driver's failure to yield to the pedestrian, can rapidly result in a collision. It emphasizes the importance of cautious driving near parked cars and the need for drivers to anticipate unpredictable pedestrian behavior in urban settings."

    "gt": "This accident occurs at night at a T-intersection within an urban area, on a dry asphalt road. Traffic volume is moderate, and the traffic light for vehicles is green. In accordance with the signal, a white SUV in front of the dashcam-equipped vehicle proceeds through the intersection at an estimated speed of 20–30 km/h. At that moment, a pedestrian dressed in black suddenly jaywalks across the intersection, moving quickly from the left to the right side of the road. As the pedestrian steps in front of the white SUV, the driver fails to notice him and continues driving straight. This results in a collision between the vehicle and the pedestrian. The impact causes the pedestrian to be thrown onto the right sidewalk, where he falls to the ground. The SUV comes to a stop shortly after the collision. This incident highlights how illegal and sudden pedestrian movements, such as jaywalking, can lead to serious traffic accidents—even in situations where vehicles are following traffic signals properly."

He is dressed in a gray sleeveless shirt, black pants, black shoes, and carries a black backpack. Initially positioned on the left sidewalk, he suddenly steps onto the road, attempting to jaywalk across to the right sidewalk by passing in front of the vehicle equipped with the dashcam. At that moment, the dashcam vehicle is traveling at approximately 30 km/h and notices the pedestrian abruptly entering its path. The driver immediately applies the brakes, successfully avoiding a collision. This situation results in a near-miss incident. The scene highlights how a pedestrian’s sudden jaywalking can quickly escalate into a potentially serious accident, emphasizing the importance of caution and attentiveness in urban traffic environments."

    "gt": "The pedestrian involved in the accident is a young child wearing a red shirt and dark pants. On an overcast day, the child attempts to jaywalk across a narrow, dry asphalt residential road with parked vehicles lining both sides. The child suddenly emerges from behind a black car parked on the left side of the street and runs into the roadway, crossing toward the right. At this moment, the dashcam-equipped vehicle is traveling straight at approximately 30 km/h. Due to the child’s abrupt entry into its path, the driver has very limited reaction time. The vehicle attempts to swerve left in an evasive maneuver, but the short braking distance, narrow alleyway, and obstructed view from nearby parked vehicles make it impossible to avoid the child completely. As a result, the front right section of the vehicle collides with the child. This scene illustrates a collision between a steadily moving vehicle and a child pedestrian who suddenly entered the roadway in a residential area. The sequence effectively highlights the dynamics of the incident, including the limited reaction window, the physical constraints of the environment, and the precise point of impact."

Parked vehicles line both sides of the street, interspersed with sparse trees. A young child, dressed in a dark checkered jacket and light-colored pants, suddenly dashes from the right roadside into the center of the road, closely followed by an adult male wearing a white T-shirt, blue jeans, and a blue cap. The child abruptly enters the vehicle’s path without hesitation, prompting the dashcam-equipped vehicle—traveling straight at approximately 20 km/h—to initiate an immediate emergency brake upon detecting the pedestrian. Thanks to the driver's quick response, a major collision is narrowly avoided, though the situation remains highly dangerous. This near-miss underscores how a pedestrian's sudden entry into the road can easily escalate into a serious accident, highlighting the critical need for vigilance and proactive safety measures in residential urban environments."

At the time, the traffic signal for vehicles is green, indicating that the pedestrian is jaywalking. Simultaneously, a black sedan in front of the dashcam-equipped vehicle is proceeding straight through the intersection at approximately 30 km/h. As the pedestrian suddenly enters the vehicle's path, the driver attempts to brake abruptly.

There are no marked pedestrian crossings nearby, indicating that the pedestrian is jaywalking. Simultaneously, the dashcam vehicle is moving straight at approximately 30 km/h. Upon spotting the pedestrian, the driver immediately attempts to brake and steer left to avoid a collision. However, the distance is too short to fully avoid impact, resulting in a collision between the pedestrian and the front right section of the vehicle.

Upon detecting the stopped vehicle, the truck driver quickly steers to the right in an attempt to avoid a rear-end collision, veering onto the sidewalk. At that moment, an adult male pedestrian wearing gray clothing is walking normally on the sidewalk with his back turned toward the approaching truck. As the truck mounts the sidewalk, its trajectory overlaps with the pedestrian’s path, resulting in a forceful collision between the front of the truck and the pedestrian. The impact propels the pedestrian forward, causing him to fall onto the sidewalk. A nearby wooden fence is also destroyed by the vehicle. The truck comes to a stop shortly after the point of impact.

The pedestrian suddenly steps off the curb and enters the path of the dashcam vehicle, moving diagonally to the right across the lanes. The vehicle is traveling straight at approximately 14–18 km/h. As the pedestrian reaches the center of the lane near the front of the vehicle, the driver decelerates and appears to successfully avoid a collision. However, just after passing the front of the vehicle, the pedestrian unexpectedly changes direction and approaches the passenger side, resulting in a minor contact with the vehicle.

Moderate sunlight creates occasional glare on the road. The pedestrian begins to cross the street from the right sidewalk to the left with a steady and cautious gait. At that moment, a black vehicle is traveling straight in the rightmost lane at approximately 50 km/h, maintaining its trajectory toward the crosswalk without any signs of deceleration or evasive steering. The pedestrian continues to cross in a direction that intersects with the vehicle’s path, and his movement is clearly visible to the driver. However, the vehicle ultimately does not slow down and proceeds straight through the crosswalk. The pedestrian notices the approaching vehicle and manages to stop abruptly, narrowly avoiding a collision—resulting in a near-miss.
