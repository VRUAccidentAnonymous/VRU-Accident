The environment is an urban street with tram lines overhead, indicating a city setting. A black car approaches from behind, its brake lights on, signaling it's slowing down or stopping. In front of this car, there's a pedestrian crossing the street, wearing dark clothing and carrying a yellow bag. As the black car stops, the pedestrian continues to cross without noticing the stopped vehicle. The black car then starts moving forward again, hitting the pedestrian who was in the middle of the road. The impact causes the pedestrian to fall backward onto the road. The colors are muted due to the overcast weather, with grey dominating the scene."
