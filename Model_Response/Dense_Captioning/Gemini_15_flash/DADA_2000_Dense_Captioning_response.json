    "pred": "On a sunny day, a male pedestrian wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and dark-colored shorts rides a bicycle with an orange bag attached to the handlebars.  He is traveling in a straight trajectory along a narrow, two-way road with a paved surface, passing parked vehicles on either side of the road. The road appears to be in a residential or commercial area with buildings lining both sides. The bicyclist maintains a moderate speed, appearing to be focused on his path ahead. As he approaches a section with parked cars, he continues riding straight without visibly checking his surroundings. Simultaneously, a dark-colored sedan is slowly reversing out of a parking space, moving in a straight trajectory toward the bicycle's path. The bicyclist, seemingly unaware of the reversing vehicle, does not change his course or speed. The reversing vehicle makes contact with the bicycle, causing the bicyclist to fall to the ground, and his bicycle to land nearby.  The vehicle appears to be traveling at a very low speed, estimated at less than 5 km/h during the reverse maneuver."

A male pedestrian, wearing a light-colored shirt and khaki pants, rides a yellow bicycle along the right-hand side of the road.  A blue motorized tricycle is traveling in the same direction slightly ahead of the cyclist.  A white SUV travels behind them at a moderate speed, approximately 20-25 km/h.  As the SUV approaches an intersection, the cyclist and tricycle continue in a straight trajectory, while the SUV begins a right turn at a slightly reduced speed.  The pedestrian on the bicycle, maintaining a relatively constant speed, doesn't significantly alter his course or speed and is struck by the right-front side of the turning SUV. The impact point occurs at the intersection."

A woman, wearing a dark-colored coat, is seen bending over to pick up something from the ground near the curb.  She is positioned near the edge of the roadway, facing away from oncoming traffic.  A light-brown SUV, traveling at a relatively low speed (estimated under 20 km/h), approaches her from the opposite direction. As the SUV nears, the woman appears to continue her activity with no immediate change in her posture. The SUV continues straight without noticeable braking or swerving and collides with the woman, who is subsequently knocked to the ground."

A male pedestrian, wearing a dark-colored jacket and pants, walks along the edge of the road near a construction site. He is walking in the same direction as the approaching vehicle. A white sedan is parked partially obstructing the view of an oncoming motorcycle.  The dashcam vehicle, traveling at approximately 20 km/h, approaches the pedestrian. The pedestrian, seemingly unaware of the approaching vehicle, suddenly and swiftly attempts to cross the road directly in front of the dashcam vehicle.  The vehicle brakes, but the impact is unavoidable, resulting in a collision with the pedestrian near the center of the road. The motorcycle, initially behind the parked car, is also involved in the incident, possibly colliding with debris or the pedestrian, subsequently."

A woman in a red coat is walking across the street, initially heading diagonally toward the camera's viewpoint from right to left at a moderate pace.  She then slightly alters her course and continues walking at roughly the same speed while looking straight ahead.  Simultaneously, a dark-colored SUV approaches from the background and travels relatively slowly down the road towards the pedestrian at a low speed.  As the vehicle gets closer, the woman continues her trajectory without appearing to notice the approaching vehicle. The vehicle successfully avoids a collision with the pedestrian, stopping just short of her as she completes her crossing.  No impact occurs."

A red, large cargo truck is traveling in the same direction as the dashcam vehicle at a relatively slow speed.  A pedestrian, seemingly a woman wearing dark clothing, is walking in the same direction as the truck, close to the edge of the road.  As the truck approaches the pedestrian, the woman appears to suddenly step or fall into the path of the truck's right-side tires. The truck, maintaining a slow speed,  makes little to no attempt to brake or swerve before the collision. The woman's body then comes into contact with the front right tire of the truck before falling to the ground. The dashcam vehicle is some distance behind the truck and does not appear to be involved in the collision."

A yellow bus is traveling slowly uphill, approximately 10 km/h, closely followed by a red semi-truck.  A person on a motorbike is traveling in the same direction as the bus and truck, riding near the edge of the road. As the bus and truck negotiate the curve, the motorbike slows significantly, appearing to stop momentarily. The bus, while maintaining a slow speed, continues its trajectory slightly towards the motorbike's position.  The bus and motorbike collide, with the impact occurring near the right rear of the bus and slightly to the left of center of the motorbike's trajectory. The bus's forward movement continues briefly after the impact. The pedestrian's behavior suggests an attempt to stop but does not account for the bus's proximity before the collision."

A woman, appearing to be middle-aged and wearing dark clothing, is riding a motorized three-wheeled cart carrying goods. The cart approaches a crosswalk where several cars are stopped; however, the woman continues into the intersection and then proceeds down the road, traveling alongside and in the same direction as a white car.  The white car, maintaining a relatively low speed, is following the cart. The woman, appearing to be focused on her route, suddenly veers sharply to the left and directly into the path of the oncoming vehicle, whose speed appears to be approximately 20-25 km/h. The impact occurs on the right-hand side of the white vehicle, near the hood. The woman’s trajectory suggests a sudden, unexpected turn causing the collision."

A man in a dark jacket and a child in a red vest are walking across a crosswalk. Simultaneously, a woman riding a bicycle with two children in a cart attached to it is also crossing the crosswalk from the opposite direction.  The bicycle, traveling at a moderate speed, is overtaken by a second bicyclist (male) who attempts to avoid colliding with the woman's bicycle and cart. This causes the woman and her cart to lose balance, falling into the path of the dashcam vehicle. The dashcam vehicle is traveling at a relatively low speed and has adequate braking time to stop before reaching the collision zone, although it does not come to a complete stop before coming into contact with the fallen bicycle and cart. The collision appears to be of low severity; there's no significant damage or severe impact evident, with the main impact being between the dashcam vehicle and the bicycle/cart and minor contact or no contact between the vehicle"

The road surface appears to be dry asphalt.  The camera is mounted in a vehicle traveling in the right lane at approximately 15-20 km/h. The cyclists are proceeding relatively slowly along the roadside, while the pedestrians are crossing the road at the crosswalk. As the camera vehicle approaches the crosswalk, the male cyclist unexpectedly swerves left, directly into the path of the approaching vehicle.  The vehicle, maintaining its speed and trajectory, collides with the male cyclist. The female pedestrian continues walking, seemingly unaware of the immediate crash."

He is approaching a crosswalk. A white sedan, traveling approximately 15-20 km/h, approaches the intersection from the opposite direction and begins to turn right. The scooter driver, initially moving at a moderate pace, slows slightly as he approaches the crosswalk. A pedestrian in a light-colored shirt crosses in front of the scooter, from left to right, with the scooter already in the crosswalk. As the sedan turns, its trajectory intersects with the scooter's path within the crosswalk, resulting in a collision where the scooter's front strikes the sedan's right front side.  The scooter and driver are visibly impacted by the collision, with the impact appearing to mostly affect the scooter's front end."
