A male pedestrian, wearing a blue sleeveless shirt and dark shorts, is riding a red children's bicycle. He is traveling in the same direction as the sedan, at the intersection. As the sedan approaches the crossing, the cyclist abruptly swerves to the left, directly into the path of the oncoming sedan, changing his trajectory almost perpendicularly. The sedan attempts to brake, but impacts the rear wheel of the bicycle, resulting in the cyclist falling to the ground. The sedan's speed at impact is significantly reduced, and the trajectory of the bicycle suggests a sharp and unexpected change in direction by the cyclist immediately prior to collision."

A pedestrian, appearing to be a female wearing dark clothing, is crossing the road diagonally from the left.  As the hatchback approaches, the pedestrian continues crossing, seemingly unaware of the approaching vehicle. The vehicle impacts the pedestrian near the front bumper, causing the pedestrian to be momentarily lifted into the air before falling to the ground. The second incident takes place on a multi-lane, divided highway with light snow cover.  The weather appears overcast. A pedestrian, possibly male, wearing dark clothing, runs across the highway from the right side of the frame to the left, perpendicular to oncoming traffic. The vehicles traveling on the highway are operating at a moderate speed (approximately 40-50 km/h). The pedestrian runs directly into the path of a dark-colored SUV, resulting in a collision."
