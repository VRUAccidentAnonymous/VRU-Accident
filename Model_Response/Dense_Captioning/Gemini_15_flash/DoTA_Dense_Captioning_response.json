The pedestrian, an adult male wearing dark clothing, is initially visible walking along the right-hand edge of the road, facing away from the approaching vehicle.  The vehicle, traveling at a speed that fluctuates between approximately 75 km/h and 23 km/h, is approaching from behind the pedestrian. The vehicle's trajectory is largely straight. As the vehicle approaches, the pedestrian briefly glances backward before continuing in the same direction, seemingly unaware of the oncoming vehicle's close proximity.  The vehicle's speed reduces as it closes the distance to the pedestrian.  The final impact occurs when the pedestrian is relatively close to the edge of the road, with the vehicle colliding with the pedestrian's right side."

The pedestrian, initially walking at a moderate pace, appears to accelerate his pace slightly as the vehicle gets closer. The vehicle's trajectory remains largely straight until the moment of impact. Despite the relatively close proximity and the pedestrian's movement into the vehicle's path, the pedestrian doesn't appear to make any sudden evasive maneuvers.  The vehicle has minimal time to react before impacting the pedestrian.
