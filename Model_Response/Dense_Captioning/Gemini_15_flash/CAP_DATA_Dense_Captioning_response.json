A male pedestrian, wearing a dark jacket and dark pants, is seen crossing the road from left to right, running at a moderate pace directly in front of a yellow taxi traveling in the same direction.  Several other vehicles are present, moving in both directions at varying speeds. The taxi, traveling at an estimated 20-25 km/h, maintains its speed and trajectory. The pedestrian, initially looking somewhat forward, briefly glances to his right as he approaches the tram tracks, but doesn't appear to fully notice the approaching taxi until he is almost directly in its path. The taxi driver brakes sharply, causing a noticeable deceleration, avoiding a direct impact; the pedestrian narrowly escapes collision by running slightly to his right.  The close distance between the pedestrian and the taxi at the point of the near-miss suggests a minimal margin of error in avoiding the accident."
