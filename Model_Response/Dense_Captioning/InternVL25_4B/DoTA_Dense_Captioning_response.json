The traffic light ahead shows red.\n\nInitially, the vehicle in front of the camera is a large truck with a covered load, following the lane rules and at a steady speed. The roadway appears wet, with clear lane markings and standard traffic setups, including traffic lights and pedestrian crossings. \n\nAs the vehicle approaches an intersection, a pedestrian wearing a dark-colored outfit starts crossing the street, taking a casual posture, suggesting a distraction or unawareness of the vehicle's approach. The traffic signal changes from red to green, allowing the vehicle to advance. However, the truck in front continues to follow the queue behind it. The pedestrian, seemingly oblivious to the traffic movement, continues to cross,"

    "pred": "This video depicts a nighttime urban setting with heavy snow accumulation on the roads. Visibility is moderately reduced, likely due to the wet road conditions and light snow. The scene is filmed from inside a car, with the dashboard clearly visible in the bottom portion of the frame.\n\nInitially, a white vehicle is approaching head-on with its brake lights activated, indicating it is slowing down or may be stationary. The pedestrian, dressed in dark clothing, is cautiously crossing the road from left to right. The pedestrian starts off steadily, observing the car's approach, and continues to cross, gradually moving towards the opposite side of the road.\n\nAs the video progresses, the pedestrian is seen extending further into the crosswalk, moving closer to the right edge where the snowbank is accumulated. The car's brake lights persist in their current state, suggesting that either the vehicle has approached at a slow pace or remains stopped.\n\nThe pedestrian's motion is deliberate and careful, with the individual seemingly cautious of the car’s movements and the road"

    "pred": "The video depicts a daytime scene at an urban intersection with overcast weather. The environment includes multi-story apartment buildings and industrial structures with smoke stacks. A variety of vehicles, including a BMW car, a white van, and a black pickup truck, are present on the road. The road surface is wet, suggesting recent or ongoing rain. \n\nInitially, a pedestrian wearing dark clothing crossed the street from right to left against the red traffic signal. An apparent error was witnessed when the pedestrian delayed their entry onto the sidewalk, still in the middle of crossing the lane, where the rightmost lane was designated for buses, indicating it was not meant for pedestrian crossings.\n\nAt this critical moment, the pedestrian maintained steady stride as a BMW car and a black pickup truck entered the scene from the main street, moving from left to right. The BMW car was stopped at the intersection, having just come to a halt. The black pickup truck, on the opposite side of the frame, was not initially visible. These vehicles"

    "pred": "The video captures a scene on an urban street during a clear day. The weather is fair with a bright blue sky, and the road is relatively empty with minimal traffic. At around 9:20 a.m. as per the timestamp, a pedestrian crossing is set against a traffic light.\n\nA red van approaches the intersection from the left lane. The pedestrian is wearing a red puffer jacket and blue jeans, carrying a bag and using their mobile device while walking across the street. As the van approaches, the pedestrian begins to step forward, crossing the marked pedestrian area. Slightly behind, there is a blue car with a decorative object on its roof, also approaching the intersection from the same direction, driving moderately.\n\nThe van appears to increase its speed as it gets closer to the pedestrian. The pedestrian, undeterred by the vehicle's approach, accelerates their crossing, striding closer to the van. As the van gets nearer, the pedestrian turns their back to the vehicle, seemingly in"
