    "pred": "The video captures a pedestrian at a crosswalk, dressed in winter attire including a red scarf, while looking at their mobile phone. It's likely snowing or has recently snowed, as the environment is wet, and the pavement is not visible. The pedestrian is casually walking across the street.\n\nA silver Toyota is seen approaching from the left side. The vehicle moves to the right side, crossing the pedestrian's intended path of travel. As they pass, the pedestrian is still engaged with their phone, not noticing the car until it is much closer and closer to the crosswalk. In a moment of inattention, the pedestrian gets startled and moves out of the way just in time as the car nearly hits them. The car continues on its path, appearing to disregard the pedestrian’s sudden movement. The driver of the silver Toyota is not visible, but it's implied they were unaware of the pedestrian's crossing due to the phone call. The collision avoidance is close, but ultimately successful, with both the"

    "pred": "The video depicts a nighttime scene at an intersection captured from a dashcam view on a vehicle. The footage starts with several vehicles approaching a mostly empty intersection under low light conditions. One of the crosswalk signals is showing red, and a pedestrian appears to be running across the street. The environment is dimly lit with streetlights and vehicle headlights casting a glow over the scene, contributing to the darkness.\n\nThe pedestrian, wearing dark clothing and white sneakers, is shown running across the center of the crosswalk. The vehicle dashcam camera captures the motion and timing of the pedestrian’s run, noting their continuous movement across the street.\n\nAs the vehicle approaches the intersection, which has other vehicles waiting at the red signals, it senses the pedestrian’s crossing. Shortly after the pedestrian runs from the crosswalk into the middle of the road, there's a collision between the pedestrian and a white car stopped at the intersection. The vehicle then comes to a halt, positioned behind the white car, indicating it was either stopped"

    "pred": "The video depicts a collision involving a white pickup truck and a silver van at an intersection controlled by traffic lights in a city environment. The scene opens with clear weather, and the environment includes a mix of urban infrastructure and some greenery. The road is marked with clear directional arrows and pedestrian crossings.\n\nAt the start, the white pickup truck approaches the intersection from the left, heading in the direction of the camera (opposite direction to the van). The truck is moving at a moderate speed, adhering to standard driving speeds on urban roads. The silver van, positioned on the right side of the intersection, moves in a parallel but opposite direction, approaching the intersection from the opposite lane.\n\nA pedestrian, wearing a red jacket, is seen waiting at the pedestrian crossing, appearing to cross the street under the pedestrian signal, unaware of the approaching vehicles. As the truck and van approach, the pedestrian reacts by raising his hands above his head, a common signaling gesture to alert drivers.\n\nThe silver van changes its"

    "pred": "The video captures a scene on an urban street where a pedestrian, dressed in a green jacket and dark pants, was crossing the road at a pedestrian crossing. A black BMW vehicle was approaching the pedestrian crossing from the opposite direction. The weather was clear, and the road was a two-way street with vehicles moving in both directions. The pedestrian was crossing from a sidewalk next to a row of shops, including one named 'Only Kebab.' \n\nAs the pedestrian completed her crossing, a black sedan approached the pedestrian from the opposite lane. The pedestrian remained stationary on the sidewalk, observing the approaching sedan. Suddenly, the pedestrian stepped into the crosswalk path prematurely and was hit by the black sedan. The sedan appeared stationary with its passenger-side door open. The black BMW, which was traveling in the same direction but was about a few meters ahead, took evasive maneuvers to avoid the pedestrian.\n\nThe impact caused the pedestrian to collapse to the ground and remain motionless, while the black sedan came to a"
