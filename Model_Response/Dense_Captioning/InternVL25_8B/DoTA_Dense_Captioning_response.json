Street lighting and buildings illuminate the scene. Snow and ice on the road contribute to low traction and visibility.\n\nInitially, we see various vehicles driving ahead, including a silver car and a white SUV. There's a mix of cars on the road, with occasional pedestrians, but no immediate indication of danger.\n\nSuddenly, a cyclist emerges on the left side of the road. The cyclist, wearing dark clothing, is riding away from the dashcam camera, moving steadily alongside the snowbank. This creates a temporary blind spot situation, where the dashcam driver may not have immediate visibility of the cyclist’s path.\n\nAnother vehicle is seen overtaking the cyclist, while the driver's vehicle remains at a steady speed.\n\nThe danger escalates as the dashcam vehicle progress"

The road appears dry, and the lighting suggests overcast conditions. Several vehicles, including a white limousine and a white van, are stopped at the intersection due to a red light. \n\nA cyclist, wearing a high visibility jacket, is crossing the intersection from right to left at the red light.

The road has visible lane lines and speed bumps.\n\nIn the initial frames, two vehicles are in focus: a blue car in the foreground and a maroon car approaching from the right. Additionally, two pedestrians on the left sidewalk wear bright clothing; one in blue and one in red. A pedestrian in black walks towards the right sidewalk.\n\nAs the maroon car accelerates towards the crosswalk with the pedestrian in red preparing to cross, the blue car and pedestrians appear stationary. \n\nThe maroon car collides with a speed bump, momentarily stopping the vehicle. The pedestrian in red steps closer to the edge of the road.\n\nIn the next moment, the maroon car resumes speed and crashes with increasing intensity at the crosswalk. The pedestrian in red ducks out of the way, as the vehicle"
