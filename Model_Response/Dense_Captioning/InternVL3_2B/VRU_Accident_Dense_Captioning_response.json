    "pred": "On a two-way road, a black car with a white roof sticker passed a pedestrian doing a running stop on a zebra crossing. The pedestrian, wearing a green coat, ran across the street before stopping abruptly, appearing to be hit by a black car that passed by. The sidewalk was covered with fallen leaves, and the blue sky and streetlights were visible in the background. There were several parked cars lining both sides of the street, and a black car passed by as the pedestrian approached."
