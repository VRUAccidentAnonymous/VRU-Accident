The initial scene shows the vehicle approaching an intersection with traffic lights and various vehicles, including a large truck with a covered load, indicating heavy rain or recent rainfall. As the vehicle approaches the intersection, it stops at a red light, and the surrounding environment is characterized by overcast skies and wet roads.\n\nAs the vehicle waits at the intersection, another vehicle, also stopped at the same red light, is visible in the background. The traffic light changes to green, allowing the vehicle to proceed forward. The camera then shifts focus to the road ahead, where a pedestrian is seen crossing the street. The pedestrian is dressed in dark clothing and appears to be walking across the crosswalk, which is marked with white lines.\n\nThe vehicle continues to move forward, maintaining its position on the road as it approaches the pedestrian who has now reached the other side"

    "pred": "The video captures a sequence of events on a snow-covered road at night, illuminated by streetlights and vehicle headlights. Initially, the scene is set with a car driving down the road, followed closely by another vehicle. As the video progresses, the camera angle shifts to show the rear view of the first car, which appears to be stationary or moving slowly. The second vehicle continues to approach from behind, maintaining its position relative to the first car.\n\nAs the vehicles continue their journey, they come to a stop in front of a building with a sign that reads \"HOTEL.\" The environment is characterized by snow-covered ground and buildings with lit windows, indicating a cold winter setting. The road is wet, reflecting the lights from the vehicles and the surroundings.\n\nIn the background, a pedestrian is visible, walking along the sidewalk. The pedestrian's movements are subtle, suggesting a casual stroll rather than an urgent need to cross the road. The focus remains on the two vehicles and the pedestrian as they navigate through"

The scene is set in a city environment with buildings and a prominent chimney visible in the background, suggesting a cold season. The sky is overcast, indicating cloudy weather conditions.\n\nAt the beginning of the video, a white van with a license plate reading \"AP 5635\" is seen driving straight ahead, approaching the intersection where a red traffic light is illuminated. Pedestrians are crossing the street, and a bus is also present, moving along the road parallel to the van. The van's brake lights are on, indicating that it is slowing down or stopping.\n\nAs the video progresses, the van continues to approach the intersection, maintaining its position relative to the other vehicles and pedestrians. The red traffic light remains lit throughout this segment, suggesting that the van has not yet been able to proceed through the intersection. The surrounding environment, including the buildings"

    "pred": "The video captures a sequence of events on a street lined with multi-story apartment buildings, under clear skies. Initially, the scene is set with a red car parked on the left side of the frame, and a blue car in motion on the right. A pedestrian in a red jacket stands near the blue car, while another person in a yellow jacket walks towards the camera from the left. The background features a bus stop sign and a traffic light showing a green signal.\n\nAs the video progresses, the blue car approaches the intersection, and the pedestrian in the red jacket moves closer to the camera. The blue car then makes a turn at the intersection, causing a collision with the red car that was previously stationary. The impact results in the red car being partially crushed, and debris is scattered around the scene. The pedestrian in the red jacket appears to be knocked down by the force of the crash.\n\nThe aftermath shows the red car lying on its side, with the blue car still in motion, having moved away"
