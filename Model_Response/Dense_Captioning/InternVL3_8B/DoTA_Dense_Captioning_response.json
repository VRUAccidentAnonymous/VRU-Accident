    "pred": "The video depicts a sequence involving a pedestrian crossing the street at an intersection. It appears to be a sunny day as the shadows are sharp, indicating clear weather conditions. The road has a typical urban setting with multiple crosswalk markers.\n\nInitially, there is no movement between the pedestrian and vehicles. A silver car is stopped parked at a nearby corner while several other cars wait at the intersection. The pedestrian in a dark jacket and blue jeans begins to cross the street using the designated crosswalk.\n\nThe car in question moves slowly and starts to drive to proceed, making a left turn. The pedestrian, with arms outstretched for balance on a scooter, continues to walk across the street. As the car moves forward, the pedestrian continues crossing and seems to maintain a steady pace.\n\nUpon nearing the end of the crosswalk, it is observed that the car will strike the pedestrian due to a collision. The impact causes the person on the scooter to be un lifted off the ground, indicating a forceful impact."
