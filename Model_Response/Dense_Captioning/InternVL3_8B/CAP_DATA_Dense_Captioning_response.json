The cyclist passes by a silver car on the left and a white car in the center of the road.\n\nAs the vehicle continues moving, the cyclist progresses towards the right side of the road, and a white car makes a turn, crossing the cyclist's path path trajectory. The cyclist maneuvers to avoid this white car, veering slightly to the left away from its path path approach. Another car, which is also white, comes into the frame from the right moving towards the left.\n\nThe trajectory of the cyclist becomes slightly erratic as he attempts to navigate around the white car turning left, avoiding it, while proceeding to the left side of the road. The cyclist’s speed appears moderate at the time of the turn, allowing enough reaction time to avoid any immediate collision"
